  - Ah, my good friend!
  - "It seems you managed to find a fair few of our many villagers! We seem to be
    missing a few, but I\u2019m sure we can bring them along shortly!"
  - "I\u2019m certain that together, we can begin life again here under the sun,
    and build our village up as a collective this time!"
