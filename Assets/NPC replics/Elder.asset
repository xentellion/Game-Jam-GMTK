  - ...hrmm?
  - "Oh, why, hello there, bright one! Why, your timing couldn\u2019t be more impeccable!"
  - I am met with a terrible problem, my friend. For you see, my dearest Grandchild,
    sweet little Xy, he has fled the village and driven its people far apart!
  - Truth be told, our village is rather distant as is- our homes sit lone and isolated
    from one another. Few call one another friends or family, and the twisting caves
    of this undergrowth make it far too dangerous to try.
  - That is why I have devised a plan, to relocate everyone to the surface! Though
    I must admit, in my frail old age, I cannot do it alone.
  - And so I must call upon you, my friend! Travel on ahead, and speak to any of
    the villagers you may find on the way! Tell them of this plan, and send them
    to join us on the surface!
  - Please, traveler... I wish to reunite with my darling Xy more than anything.
    To live a happy life together on the surface is all I wish for.
